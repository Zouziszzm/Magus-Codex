Pages:
The pages directory is a fundamental part of Next.js. Each file inside the pages directory corresponds to a route in your application. For example, pages/index.js corresponds to the root route (/), and pages/about.js corresponds to the /about route.

Dynamic Routes:
Next.js allows you to create dynamic routes using brackets [] in the pages directory. For example, a file named pages/post/[id].js allows you to create dynamic routes like /post/1 or /post/abc.

API Routes:
You can create API routes in the pages/api directory. These routes are server-side and can be used to handle server-side logic, database operations, or any other backend functionality.

Components:
You'll likely create a components directory to store React components that are used across multiple pages. This helps in maintaining a modular and organized codebase.

Styles:
The styles directory is where you can keep your global styles or styles specific to components/pages. You might use CSS, SCSS, or a styling solution like styled-components.

Public Folder:
The public folder is used to serve static assets such as images, fonts, and other files. Files placed in the public folder are served as-is.

Layouts:
You might create a layouts directory to store layout components that wrap around your page components. This is useful for creating a consistent layout structure across multiple pages.

Head:
The Head component from next/head allows you to customize the head of your pages. This is where you can add meta tags, link to stylesheets, and perform other operations related to the document head.

Routing:
Next.js provides the Link component for client-side navigation. This allows you to create links between pages without a full page reload.

Data Fetching:
You can use functions like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps to fetch data for your pages. This is particularly useful for static site generation or server-side rendering.

Deployment:
When you're ready to deploy your Next.js application, you may need to consider deployment options. Popular choices include Vercel, Netlify, and traditional hosting solutions.
